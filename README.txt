Hi there!

This is a project with Java, PostgreSQL and Node.js.

The java part, using Java Swing for the view.
Using java for a system of CRUD (create-read-update-delete), using data persistence with CSV files, with search system dynamic.
My group and me, implemented a login and password, but, using PostgreSQL for validation, and for register, we use the node.js as backend, and we host using ngrok to open a door of my desktop for the web.
